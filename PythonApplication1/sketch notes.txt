parse snapshots every "x" ms, before adding to deque, check if it is a copy, then if not, add it to deque

parse lines backwards using ' (apostrophe)

object should have:
caster
time
wep
CSS procs
total number affected

have number of casters pre input as an option?
possibly input names of everyone beforehand?
option to have list of weapons completely input beforehand
when adding casters to list of casters, once 30 (or max) is exceeded, check to see if a name already input shares high number of characters relative to length of name
>>> all this above is to not have any extra players or weapons displayed (example: beggars secrets vs beggarss ssecretss'' or low key vs lowkey)


possible solution to parsing is to have entire log be read, thrown into array of strings, then compare end of string[x] to the beginning of string[x+1], delete until no matches and then squeeze them together.

idea for improving accuracy even further if necessary:
	try for some form of advanced thresholding. idea is to to "inverted" truncating, where values above a certain threshold are set to maximum value


keep in mind that swipe attacks dont have a name


perhaps automating the scrolling and 'nexting' of pages should be automated through the parser rather than a macro in bluestacks. might allow for faster, more accurate, and smoother parsing overall.
